// You have to create a function which receives 3 number arguments: 2 operands a and b, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them.
//
// Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.
//
// The possible return strings are: "addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division".
//
// Examples:
// (a = 1, b = 2, result = 3)   --> 1 ? 2 = 3   --> "addition"
// (a = 5, b = 2, result = 2.5) --> 5 ? 2 = 2.5 --> "division"
// Notes
// The / operator performs a plain division without rounding.
// You can assume that there will always be a unique valid answer (no ambiguous cases like e.g. 1 ? 0 = 0 which could be either - or +, or 3 ? 1 = 3 which could be either * or /).
// You can assume that there will be no division by 0
//
// function calcType(a, b, res) {
//   // your code here
// }

function calcType(a, b, res) {
  if (a + b === res) return "addition";
  if (a - b === res) return "subtraction";
  if (a * b === res) return "multiplication";
  return "division";
}

// Arrow function and ternary
const calcType = (a, b, res) => (a + b === res) ? "addition" : (a - b === res) ? "subtraction" : (a * b === res) ?"multiplication" : "division";
