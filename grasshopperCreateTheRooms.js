// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).
//
// // Add rooms here
// var rooms = {
//
// }

var rooms = {
  room1: {
    name: "Living Room",
    description: "tbd",
    completed: false,
  },
  room2: {
    name: "Kitchen",
    description: "tbd",
    completed: false,
  },
  room3: {
    name: "Bedroom",
    description: "tbd",
    completed: false,
  },
};
