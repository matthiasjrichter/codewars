// Task
// Timed Reading is an educational tool used in many schools to improve and advance reading skills. A young elementary student has just finished his very first timed reading exercise. Unfortunately he's not a very good reader yet, so whenever he encountered a word longer than maxLength, he simply skipped it and read on.
//
// Help the teacher figure out how many words the boy has read by calculating the number of words in the text he has read, no longer than maxLength.
//
// Formally, a word is a substring consisting of English letters, such that characters to the left of the leftmost letter and to the right of the rightmost letter are not letters.
//
// Example
// For maxLength = 4 and text = "The Fox asked the stork, 'How is the soup?'", the output should be 7
//
// The boy has read the following words: "The", "Fox", "the", "How", "is", "the", "soup".
//
// Input/Output
// [input] integer maxLength
//
// A positive integer, the maximum length of the word the boy can read.
//
// Constraints: 1 ≤ maxLength ≤ 10.
//
// [input] string text
//
// A non-empty string of English letters and punctuation marks.
//
// [output] an integer
//
// The number of words the boy has read.

// for of loop and counter
function timedReading(maxLength, text) {
  let words = text.replace(/[^a-zA-Z\s]/g, "").split(" ");
  let wordsRead = 0;
  for (let word of words) {
    if (word.length && word.length <= maxLength) wordsRead++;
  }
  return wordsRead;
}

// One line for fun
const timedReading = (maxLength, text) => text.replace(/[^a-zA-Z\s]/g, "").split(" ").filter((word) => word.length && word.length <= maxLength).length;

// .match(), nullish coalescing operator and shorter variable names
const timedReading = (l, t) => (t.match(/[a-zA-Z]+/g) ?? []).filter(e => e.length <= l).length;
